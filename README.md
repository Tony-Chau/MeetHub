# MeetHub-Cloud-Computing-
This project was created for CAB432 Cloud Computing from QUT

The project was to use 3 APIs. In this case, the Meetup, Bing Maps and Google Calendar API were used. 

The project runs in Nodejs and Pug.

The website allows users to look for available events around along with description (Meetup) (if available), locate their destination (Bing Maps) and could potentially add the time of the event to their own personal calendar within their Google account (Google Calendar).
