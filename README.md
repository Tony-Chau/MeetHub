# MeetHub-Cloud-Computing-
This project was created during CAB432 Cloud Computing from QUT

This website uses Meetup, Bing Maps and Google Calendar API. The project was created in nodejs.

The main purpose of this website is to allow users to look for available events around along with description (Meetup), locate their destination (bing maps) and could potentially add the time of the event to their own personal calendar using OAuth (Google Calendar)
