# MeetHub-Cloud-Computing-
This project was created during CAB432 Cloud Computing course from QUT

This website uses Meetup, Bing Maps and Google Calendar API. 

The project runs in Nodejs and Pug.

The main purpose of this website is to allow users to look for available events around along with description (Meetup), locate their destination (Bing Maps) and could potentially add the time of the event to their own personal calendar (Google Calendar).
